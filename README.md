# fun.belka
Funny frontend JS code snippet (1 April joke)

# Howto
- you need JQuery for animation (not included in repo)
- check code on belka.js, maybe include this file content directly in some HTML code by <script> tag
- you will need one global scope variable name (aprFun) to prevent multiple popups
- popup will be produced with selected probability when somebody scrolls window over some magic positons (see belka.js - "if" condition)
- 140px in my case is a one single scroll by keyboard + one single scroll step by mouse. If you will play then with +/- 1 scroll by keyboard, you will got squirrel images for sure.

# Hints
- configure appearance probabiliy to low treshold - to got rare but regular cases of squirrel appearance
- read user's chats
- Have fun!
